Otherwise, continue with resolution per the plan below.

TECH DEBT RESOLUTION

READ:
(1) Tech debt description at {{.file_path}}
(2) CLAUDE.md for coding standards and patterns
(3) Related code areas (grep for affected components)

IMPLEMENT:

Step 1 — ANALYZE:
- Understand the scope and impact of the tech debt
- Identify affected files and components

Step 2 — RESOLVE:
- Implement the resolution following existing patterns
- Ensure no regressions are introduced

Step 3 — QUALITY GATE (MANDATORY):
```bash
make fmt && make lint && make test
```
Fix ALL failures before advancing. No exceptions.

EXIT GATE:
- Tech debt is resolved
- Quality gate passes
- No unrelated changes
