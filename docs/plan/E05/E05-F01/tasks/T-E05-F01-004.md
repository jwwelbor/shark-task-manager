# Task: Implement Status Output Formatting

## Goal

Implement rich terminal output: project summary display, epic table with progress bars, active tasks grouped by agent, blocked tasks with reasons, recent completions with relative time. Color coding (green/yellow/red), terminal width detection, --no-color support.

## API Endpoints

### Endpoints to Implement

- [ ] Endpoint routes defined
- [ ] Request/response schemas documented
- [ ] Authentication/authorization requirements identified

## Data Models

### Database Schema

- [ ] Business rules implemented

## Implementation Details

### Service Layer

- [ ] Service methods defined
- [ ] Transaction boundaries identified
- [ ] External service integrations documented

### Error Handling

- [ ] Error types defined
- [ ] Error responses standardized
- [ ] Logging strategy implemented

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All endpoints return correct responses
- [ ] Input validation working
- [ ] Error handling complete
- [ ] Database operations atomic
- [ ] Performance targets met

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Service layer tests
- [ ] Business logic tests
- [ ] Validation tests
- [ ] Error handling tests

### Integration Tests
