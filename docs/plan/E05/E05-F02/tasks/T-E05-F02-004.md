# Task: Dependency Management Testing and Documentation

## Goal

Comprehensive testing: cycle detection tests, tree visualization tests, integration with task operations, edge cases (self-references, long chains). Unit and integration tests. Performance testing. Documentation updates for dependency features.

## Test Scenarios

### Positive Test Cases

- [ ] Happy path scenario 1
- [ ] Happy path scenario 2
- [ ] Happy path scenario 3

### Negative Test Cases

- [ ] Invalid input scenario 1
- [ ] Invalid input scenario 2
- [ ] Error condition scenario 1

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Boundary condition 1
- [ ] Boundary condition 2
- [ ] Concurrent operation handling

## Test Data Requirements

### Input Data

- [ ] Valid test data prepared
- [ ] Invalid test data prepared
- [ ] Edge case test data prepared

### Expected Outputs

- [ ] Expected results documented
- [ ] Error messages documented
- [ ] State changes documented

## Coverage Requirements

### Unit Test Coverage

- Target: ≥80% line coverage
- [ ] All public methods tested
- [ ] All branches covered
- [ ] Error paths tested

### Integration Test Coverage

- [ ] Component interactions tested
- [ ] Database operations tested
- [ ] External service calls tested

## Performance Benchmarks

- [ ] Response time targets defined
- [ ] Throughput requirements identified
- [ ] Resource usage limits documented

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All test scenarios passing
- [ ] Coverage targets met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks satisfied
- [ ] No critical bugs remaining
- [ ] Test documentation complete

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Performance tests
- [ ] Security tests

### Test Environment

- [ ] Test environment configured
- [ ] Test data seeded
- [ ] External dependencies mocked/stubbed

## Notes

- Follow project testing conventions
- Use appropriate test fixtures
- Document any test infrastructure changes
- Include regression tests for bugs found
