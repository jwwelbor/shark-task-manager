title: Implement Circular Dependency Detection Algorithm
---


# Task: Implement Circular Dependency Detection Algorithm

## Goal

Build dependency graph traversal and cycle detection algorithm. Implement validation logic that checks for circular dependencies when adding new dependencies. Prevent cycles before creation. Uses graph algorithms (DFS) to detect cycles efficiently.

## API Endpoints

### Endpoints to Implement

- [ ] Endpoint routes defined
- [ ] Request/response schemas documented
- [ ] Authentication/authorization requirements identified

## Data Models

### Database Schema

- [ ] Tables/collections identified
- [ ] Relationships defined
- [ ] Indexes planned
- [ ] Migrations prepared

### Business Logic

- [ ] Domain models defined
- [ ] Validation rules documented
- [ ] Business rules implemented

## Implementation Details

### Service Layer

- [ ] Service methods defined
- [ ] Transaction boundaries identified
- [ ] External service integrations documented

### Error Handling

- [ ] Error types defined
- [ ] Error responses standardized
- [ ] Logging strategy implemented

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All endpoints return correct responses
- [ ] Input validation working
- [ ] Error handling complete
- [ ] Database operations atomic
- [ ] Performance targets met

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Service layer tests
- [ ] Business logic tests
- [ ] Validation tests
- [ ] Error handling tests

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Database integration tests
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] External service integration tests

## Notes

- Follow REST/GraphQL conventions
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Document all assumptions and trade-offs
