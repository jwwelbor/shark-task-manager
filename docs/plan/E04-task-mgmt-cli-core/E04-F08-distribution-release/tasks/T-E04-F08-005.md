# Task: Documentation & Production Release

## Goal

Complete user-facing and maintainer documentation for installation and release processes, then cut and publish the production v1.0.0 release, making Shark CLI available to all users through multiple distribution channels.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] README.md updated with comprehensive installation instructions for all platforms
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md updated with complete release process documentation
- [ ] SECURITY.md created with vulnerability reporting and checksum verification
- [ ] Release verification scripts created for Linux/macOS and Windows
- [ ] Production release `v1.0.0` successfully created and published
- [ ] All distribution channels verified and working in production
- [ ] Release announcement prepared (optional)
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for accuracy and completeness

## Implementation Guidance

### Overview

Finalize all documentation needed for users to install Shark and for maintainers to manage releases, then execute the production v1.0.0 release. Publish the release and verify all distribution channels are operational before announcing availability.

### Key Requirements

- **User Documentation**: Clear, platform-specific installation instructions with examples - See [Architecture - User Documentation](../02-architecture.md#user-documentation)
- **Maintainer Documentation**: Complete release process workflow for future releases - See [Implementation - Release Process](../08-implementation-phases.md#release-process-documentation)
- **Security Documentation**: Checksum verification steps and vulnerability reporting - See [Security - User Security Guidance](../06-security-design.md#user-security-guidance)
- **Verification Scripts**: Automated scripts users can run to verify installations - See [Test Criteria - Verification Scripts](../09-test-criteria.md#verification-scripts)
- **Production Release**: Confident v1.0.0 release after validation in Task 004 - See [Implementation - Production Release](../08-implementation-phases.md#phase-5-documentation--production-release)

### Files to Create/Modify

**User Documentation**:
- `README.md` - Add installation section with all methods
- `SECURITY.md` - Create security and vulnerability reporting guide
- `docs/user-guide/installation.md` - Detailed installation guide (if separate from README)

**Maintainer Documentation**:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Add release process section
- `docs/maintainer-guide/releases.md` - Detailed release procedure
- `docs/maintainer-guide/troubleshooting-releases.md` - Common issues and fixes

**Verification Scripts**:
- `scripts/verify-release.sh` - Linux/macOS release verification (checks all platforms)
- `scripts/verify-release.ps1` - Windows release verification (PowerShell)

**Release Tag**:
- Create Git tag: `v1.0.0`
- Push to trigger production release

### Integration Points

- **All Distribution Channels**: Documentation must cover GitHub Releases, Homebrew, and Scoop
- **Existing Documentation**: Integrate with existing README and contributor guides
- **Future Maintainers**: Documentation must be clear enough for new maintainers to manage releases
- **User Support**: Clear documentation reduces support burden

Reference: [Architecture - Documentation Integration](../02-architecture.md#documentation-integration)

## Validation Gates

**Documentation Review**:
- README.md installation section is clear and complete
- Each platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) has clear instructions
- Code examples are correct and tested
- Links to package manager repositories work correctly
- Checksum verification steps are explained clearly

**Verification Script Testing**:
- Run `scripts/verify-release.sh` on Linux - must pass all checks
- Run `scripts/verify-release.sh` on macOS - must pass all checks
- Run `scripts/verify-release.ps1` on Windows - must pass all checks
- Scripts properly handle missing dependencies (e.g., no curl)
- Scripts provide helpful error messages on failures

**Release Process Documentation Review**:
- CONTRIBUTING.md release section is complete
- Step-by-step release instructions are clear
- Version numbering guidelines follow SemVer
- Troubleshooting section covers common failures
- Token renewal process documented

**Production Release Validation**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure all tests pass
go test ./...

# 2. Create and push production tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# 3. Monitor workflow
# Check: https://github.com/jwwelbor/shark-task-manager/actions

# 4. Review draft release
# Navigate to: https://github.com/jwwelbor/shark-task-manager/releases
# Verify release notes, assets, checksums

# 5. Publish release (convert from draft to published)

# 6. Test installations
# Homebrew
brew install jwwelbor/shark/shark
shark --version  # Should show: v1.0.0

# Scoop
scoop install shark
shark --version  # Should show: v1.0.0

# Manual
wget https://github.com/jwwelbor/shark-task-manager/releases/download/v1.0.0/shark_1.0.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/jwwelbor/shark-task-manager/releases/download/v1.0.0/checksums.txt
sha256sum -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
tar -xzf shark_*.tar.gz
./shark --version  # Should show: v1.0.0
```

**Post-Release Verification**:
- Verify release is public (not draft)
- Test installation on fresh machine (no prior Shark installation)
- Verify package managers show latest version (may take time to sync)
- Check download counts after 24 hours (basic adoption metric)

- **SemVer Guidelines**: Document when to bump MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH versions in CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Token Renewal**: Add clear instructions for renewing PATs when they expire (every 90 days)
- **Troubleshooting**: Include common issues: "workflow fails on tests", "binary not found after install", "checksum mismatch"
- **Announcement**: Optional - consider announcement on project channels, social media, or relevant communities
- **Celebration**: This completes the feature! 🎉 Shark CLI now has professional, automated distribution
