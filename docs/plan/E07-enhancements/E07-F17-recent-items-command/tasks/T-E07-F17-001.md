# Task: Implement shark recent command

## Goal

Create 'shark recent' command showing newest items across tasks, features, epics sorted by created_at descending.

Usage:
  shark recent              # Show 5 most recent items (all types)
  shark recent 10           # Show 10 most recent items
  shark recent --limit=10   # Same as above
  shark recent --tasks      # Only tasks
  shark recent --features   # Only features  
  shark recent --epics      # Only epics
  shark recent --json       # JSON output

Default limit configurable via .sharkconfig.json (recent.default_limit: 5).

Output columns: Type, Key, Title, Created, Status
