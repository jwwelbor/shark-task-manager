# ⚠️ SUPERSEDED BY E07-F19

**This task has been superseded by Feature E07-F19: File Path Flag Standardization**

After investigation and architecture review, this single task evolved into a full feature with 7 coordinated tasks:

- **T-E07-F19-001**: Database schema migration
- **T-E07-F19-002**: Feature command flag standardization
- **T-E07-F19-003**: Epic command flag standardization
- **T-E07-F19-004**: Task command flag standardization
- **T-E07-F19-005**: Update data models
- **T-E07-F19-006**: Documentation updates
- **T-E07-F19-007**: Integration and E2E testing

# Original Task Scope

## Context

Investigation revealed that `feature update --path` stores the value in `custom_folder_path` but never uses it in file path calculations. This is a fundamental architectural issue affecting epics, features, and tasks.

**Architecture Decision:** Use single `file_path` column storing full file path. Drop `custom_folder_path` column entirely.

See: `dev-artifacts/2026-01-02-feature-update-path-bug/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md`

## Why This Became a Feature

**Original scope (1 task):**
- Just fix feature update --path

**Discovered scope (feature-worthy):**
- Affects 3 entity types (epic, feature, task)
- Requires schema migration (high impact)
- 9+ files to modify
- Multiple independent work streams
- 12 hours / 1.5 days effort
- Parallelizable implementation

**Decision:** Break into feature with 7 tasks for better tracking and parallel execution.

## Analysis Documents

All analysis preserved in `dev-artifacts/2026-01-02-feature-update-path-bug/`:
- **ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md** - Final decision and rationale
- **CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md** - What's broken
- **PATH_FILENAME_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Original hierarchical proposal
- **REFACTORING_PLAN.md** - Original 10-phase plan (not used)
- **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** - Decision summary

## Key Insight

Files don't move in typical workflow. 95% use default convention, 5% need custom locations at creation time. The `custom_folder_path` column was solving an imaginary reorganization problem.

**Solution:** Use single `file_path` column with full path. Simple, fast, matches actual usage.
