# Task: Enhance Epic Get Command Display

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour
**Phase:** 3 - CLI Display Enhancements

---

## Goal

Add feature rollup, task rollup, and impediments sections to `shark epic get` command.

---

## Implementation

**Files to Modify:** `internal/cli/commands/epic.go`

Update `runEpicGetCommand()`:
1. Get feature rollup: `featureRollup, err := featureRepo.GetFeatureStatusRollup(ctx, epic.ID)`
2. Get task rollup: `taskRollup, err := epicRepo.GetTaskStatusRollup(ctx, epic.ID)`
3. Format output with new sections:
   - Feature Status Summary (by phase)
   - Task Rollup (across all features)
   - Impediments & Risks (blocked features, approval backlog)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Feature status rollup by phase
- [ ] Task rollup across all features
- [ ] Impediments section with blocked features
- [ ] Approval backlog shown with age
- [ ] JSON output includes all rollup fields
