# Task: Enhance Feature List Command Display

**Estimated Effort:** 1.5 hours
**Phase:** 3 - CLI Display Enhancements

---

## Goal

Add health indicators (🟢🟡🔴) and notes column to `shark feature list` command.

---

## Implementation

**Files to Modify:** `internal/cli/commands/feature.go`

Update `runFeatureListCommand()`:
1. For each feature, get status breakdown
2. Calculate health indicator:
   - 🟢 Healthy: No blockers, on track
   - 🟡 Attention: 1-2 blockers OR approval backlog
   - 🔴 At Risk: 3+ blockers OR >30% blocked
3. Generate notes: "[3 ready, 2 blocked]"
4. Format progress with weighted ratio

**New Table Columns:**
```
KEY      TITLE                    HEALTH  PROGRESS              NOTES
E07-F23  Enhanced Status          🟡      68% (3.4/5)          [1 waiting approval]
```
