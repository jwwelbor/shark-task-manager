# Task: Create Status Package and Types

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours
**Phase:** 1 - Core Calculations
**Dependencies:** None (foundational task)

---

## Goal

Set up the new `internal/status` package with all core type definitions for progress tracking, work breakdown, and action items. This task creates the foundational data structures that will be used by all subsequent calculations and display enhancements.

**Key Design Principle:** Types only - no implementation logic yet. Just data structures and package documentation.

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Package Directory

```bash
mkdir -p internal/status
```

### 2. Create `internal/status/types.go`

Define all core data structures with complete documentation:

```go
// Package status provides status calculation and analysis for features and epics.
//
// This package uses config-driven calculations to:
// - Calculate weighted progress (recognizes partial work like ready_for_approval = 90%)
// - Break down work by responsibility (agent, human, blocked)
// - Identify action items (what needs attention)
// - Provide status context (e.g., "active (waiting)" vs "active (development)")
//
// All calculations are config-driven using progress_weight, responsibility, and
// blocks_feature metadata from .sharkconfig.json (configured via E07-F14).
package status

// ProgressInfo provides weighted and completion progress metrics
// Used by feature get and feature list to show realistic progress
type ProgressInfo struct {
    WeightedPct     float64  // Weighted progress (e.g., 68.0) - recognizes partial work
    CompletionPct   float64  // Traditional completion % (e.g., 40.0) - only completed tasks
    WeightedRatio   string   // "3.4/5" (weighted tasks complete)
    CompletionRatio string   // "2/5" (completed tasks / total)
    TotalTasks      int      // Total task count
}

// WorkSummary breaks down work by responsibility
// Used to show who's responsible for remaining work
type WorkSummary struct {
    TotalTasks     int  // Total tasks
    CompletedTasks int  // Fully completed
    AgentWork      int  // Tasks with responsibility="agent"
    HumanWork      int  // Tasks with responsibility="human" or "qa_team"
    BlockedWork    int  // Tasks with blocks_feature=true
    NotStarted     int  // Tasks with progress_weight=0.0 (excluding completed)
}

// ActionItems contains tasks requiring immediate attention
// Used to surface what needs PM/developer attention
type ActionItems struct {
    AwaitingApproval []*TaskActionItem  // ready_for_approval status
    Blocked          []*TaskActionItem  // blocked status
    InProgress       []*TaskActionItem  // in_progress/in_development status
}

// TaskActionItem represents a single actionable task
type TaskActionItem struct {
    TaskKey        string   // E07-F23-003
    Title          string   // Task title
    Status         string   // Current status
    AgeDays        *int     // Days in current status (for waiting tasks)
    BlockedReason  *string  // Reason for blocking (if blocked)
}

// FeatureStatusInfo contains comprehensive status information for a feature
// Returned by repository layer, used by CLI for display
type FeatureStatusInfo struct {
    Feature         interface{}           // *models.Feature (avoid import cycle)
    StatusBreakdown map[string]int        // Status -> count
    Tasks           []interface{}         // []*models.Task (avoid import cycle)
    Progress        *ProgressInfo         // Calculated progress metrics
    WorkSummary     *WorkSummary          // Work breakdown
    StatusContext   string                // "active (waiting)", "active (blocked)"
    ActionItems     *ActionItems          // Tasks needing attention
}
```

## Files to Create

- `internal/status/types.go` - All type definitions with package documentation

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `internal/status/` directory created
- [ ] `types.go` file exists with package documentation
- [ ] `ProgressInfo` struct defined with all 5 fields
- [ ] `WorkSummary` struct defined with all 6 fields
- [ ] `ActionItems` struct defined with all 3 fields
- [ ] `TaskActionItem` struct defined with all 5 fields
- [ ] `FeatureStatusInfo` struct defined with all 7 fields
- [ ] Code compiles without errors: `go build ./internal/status`
- [ ] No implementation logic yet (types only)

---

## Testing

### Compile Check

```bash
go build ./internal/status
```

Expected: No errors (types compile successfully)

### Import Check

Create simple test to verify types can be imported:

```go
package main

import "github.com/jwwelbor/shark-task-manager/internal/status"

func main() {
    _ = status.ProgressInfo{}
    _ = status.WorkSummary{}
    _ = status.ActionItems{}
}
```

---

## Notes

### Why Use `interface{}` for Feature and Tasks?

To avoid import cycles between `internal/status` and `internal/models`. The status package should not depend on models:
- Repository layer passes `*models.Feature` and `[]*models.Task`
- Status package receives them as `interface{}`
- CLI layer type-asserts back to concrete types

### Thread Safety

All types are value types or contain pointer slices. No mutexes needed since:
- Each request gets its own instances
- No shared mutable state
