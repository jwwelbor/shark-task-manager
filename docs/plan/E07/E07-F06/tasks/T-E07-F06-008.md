- [ ] Backward compatibility verified with old syntax
- [ ] Error messages match spec exactly
- [ ] Help text updated and verified
- [ ] Performance <1ms for argument parsing
- [ ] No regressions in other commands

## Testing Verification

## Dependencies

- T-E07-F06-001: Pattern matching helpers
- T-E07-F06-002: Feature list implementation
- T-E07-F06-003: Task list implementation
- T-E07-F06-004: Unit tests
- T-E07-F06-005: Feature integration tests
- T-E07-F06-006: Task integration tests
