# Show File Location on Entity Create

**Feature Key**: E25-F02-show-file-location-on-entity-create

---

## Epic

- **Epic PRD**: [Epic](../../epic.md)
- **Epic Architecture**: [Architecture](../../architecture.md) _(if available)_

---

## Goal

Modify all entity creation commands to print the file path of the created markdown file upon successful creation, eliminating the need for users and agents to guess or look up where the entity file was written. The affected commands are `runEpicCreate` in `epic.go`, `runFeatureCreate` in `feature.go`, `runCreate` in `create.go` (unified create), `runBugCreate` in `bug.go`, `runChangeCreate` in `change.go`, and the new `runTechDebtCreate` in `tech_debt.go` (the last of which is implemented as part of E25-F01 but requires this feature's pattern for consistency). Each command already holds the returned entity object from the service; the change is to call `entity.GetFilePath()` and append the file path to the success output line. This is a UI-only change requiring no service or repository modifications, and delivers SC-6 from the epic success criteria. This feature can be developed in parallel with E25-F01 but must have `tech_debt.go` available for the TD create command's file path display to be testable end-to-end.
