title: Sprint Task Assignment & Backlog
description: Delivers the commands that connect tasks (E##-F##-###), bugs (B###), change-cards (CC-###), AND tech-debt items (TD-###) to sprints: shark sprint add (individual entity assignment), shark sprint remove, shark sprint backlog (status-grouped view showing all entity types in one place), and shark sprint close with carryover logic (--carryover=next|backlog). Assignment uses the polymorphic sprint_assignments schema from E19-F01 (entity_type + entity_id) with the partial unique index that enforces one-active-sprint-per-entity at the database level. The backlog view groups the polymorphic mix by status so PMs see ALL in-flight work — tasks, bugs, change-cards, and tech-debt — in one place. The carryover transaction in SprintService is the highest-complexity operation in the epic — it atomically reassigns incomplete entities to the next sprint (or strips assignment for backlog mode), records completion statistics, and advances sprint status to completed. This feature covers REQ-F-004 through REQ-F-006 (Must Have) and depends on E19-F01 (schema) and E19-F02 (sprint lifecycle commands).
